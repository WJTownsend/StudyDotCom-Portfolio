# StudyDotCom-Portfolio

## Description

This is a repository of my work in Nov/Dec 2021 completing several classes at Study.com for college credits to transfer into Western Governors University in advance of enrolling in the Bachelor of Science in Data Management & Data Analysis program. I spent 2021 working on a variety of transfer courses from different sources, and Study.com was the last set of transfer courses that I had to complete. 

I have uploaded all of my projects to this repository for review by both prospective employers and as a potential aid for fellow students completing classes at SDC. If you are using my work to help you solve problems in these projects yourself, please be sure to acknowledge such, in compliance with SDC's Honor Code. Each of the projects here scored 100%, except where noted in the associated class review. I've also included my reviews of each class that I took at SDC, as well as the time that I spent on each class. I hope that this informs prospective students on what they're getting into. Note that the time spent includes both the classroom portion and the associated project(s).

## Acknowledgements

As always, a huge thanks goes out to my wife, Shannon. Without her support, I wouldn't be going back to school and working on a career change into data science. She's the MVP. 

For these projects, I have to give acknowledgements to [Astral Throb](https://www.youtube.com/c/AstralThrob/videos), [Oilage](https://www.youtube.com/user/lucasgelati/videos), and [Synthwave Gems](https://www.youtube.com/c/SynthwaveGems/videos). I ignored the videos in each class and only used the texts, because they're 1) less boring, and 2) allowed me to listen to jams to try to keep myself engaged. Their synthwave mixes are the perfect kind of music for me to listen to while working, being energetic and engaging without being distracted. Wherever I could, I worked with their tunes on.
